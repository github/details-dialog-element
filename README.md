# &lt;details-dialog&gt; element

A modal dialog opened with a &lt;details&gt; button.

## DEPRECATION WARNING

This web component has been deprecated. There are a number of accessibility concerns with this approach and so we no longer recommend using this component.

### Accessibility and Usability Concerns

* Semantically, using a details-summary pattern for a dialog solution can be confusing for screen reader users.
* If the user performs a "find in page" operation on a website using details-dialog elements, the content on those elements will appear when they shouldn't.
* Opening the dialog does not disable scrolling on the underlying page.

GitHub are moving towards using [a dialog Primer View Component](https://primer.style/view-components/components/alpha/dialog) which enforces certain aspects of the design (such as always having a close button and a title).

## Installation
Available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as [**@github/details-dialog-element**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@github/details-dialog-element).
```
$ npm install --save @github/details-dialog-element
```

## Usage

### Script

Import as ES modules:

```js
import '@github/details-dialog-element'
```

Include with a script tag:

```html
<script type="module" src="./node_modules/@github/details-dialog-element/dist/index.js">
```

### Markup

```html
<details>
  <summary>Open dialog</summary>
  <details-dialog>
    Modal content
    <button type="button" data-close-dialog>Close</button>
  </details-dialog>
</details>
```

## Deferred loading

Dialog content can be loaded from a server by embedding an [`<include-fragment>`][fragment] element.

```html
<details>
  <summary>Robots</summary>
  <details-dialog src="/robots" preload>
    <include-fragment>Loadingâ€¦</include-fragment>
  </details-dialog>
</details>
```

The `src` attribute value is copied to the `<include-fragment>` the first time the `<details>` button is toggled open, which starts the server fetch.

If the `preload` attribute is present, hovering over the `<details>` element will trigger the server fetch.

## Events

### `details-dialog-close`

`details-dialog-close` event is fired from `<details-dialog>` when a request to close the dialog is made from

- pressing <kbd>escape</kbd>,
- submitting a `form[method="dialog"]`
- clicking on `summary, form button[formmethod="dialog"], [data-close-dialog]`, or
- `dialog.toggle(false)`

This event bubbles, and can be canceled to keep the dialog open.

```js
document.addEventListener('details-dialog-close', function(event) {
  if (!confirm('Are you sure?')) {
    event.preventDefault()
  }
})
```
